Before we dive into the really fun parts – playbooks,
configuration management, deployment, and orchestration, 
we’ll learn how to get Ansible installed and cover some basic concepts. 
We’ll also go over how to execute ad-hoc commands in parallel 
across your nodes using /usr/bin/ansible. Additionally, 
we’ll see what sort of modules are available in Ansible’s core (though you 
can also write your own, which is also covered later).
